This is an assignment for my Server Side Scripting class INFX2670 Assignment 3

It is a hangman game that allows the user to play a simple game of hangman. The user can create an account to play and keep track of their personal score, or play as a non-registered user and be part of a collective high score. There are admin functions to upload a word list so the game is playable. MySQL is used to store user data and game data and sessions are used in PHP to keep track of the current users session and game progress.

Requirements
------------

This program requires `php` and `apache` to be installed on the server you are running this on.

This program is made to run on the bluenose.cs.dal.ca servers but should work any apache based server with PHP installed.

Installation

1. Copy files into working directory.
2. Make sure apache is running
